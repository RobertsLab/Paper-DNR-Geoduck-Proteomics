    "# Demultiplexing and converting from .raw to .mzML using MSConvert\n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook shows how to use MSConvert at the command line to convert .raw data files from the Lumos MS/MS to .mzML and simultaneously demultiplex the data. This is the first step in DIA data analysis/processing after receiving the .raw files from Lumos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Demutiplexing the data is required prior to running it through PECAN.  Demultiplexing converts data collected in small, overlapping m/z windows into non-overlapping m/z range. Data was collected in this multiplexed manner to improve precursor selectivity.  A good resource to learn more about multiplexed data see [_Multiplexed MS/MS for Improved Data Independent Acquisition_ by Jarrett D. Egertson et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881977/) (also saved in my repo [here)](https://github.com/laurahspencer/Geoduck-DNR/blob/master/References/Egertson%2C2013_Multiplexing-DIA-data.pdf)\n",
